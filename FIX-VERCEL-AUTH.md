# ðŸ”§ Fix Vercel Authentication Issue

## ðŸš¨ **Problem:**
Your Vercel deployments are showing 401 authentication errors because Vercel has project protection enabled.

## âœ… **Solution:**

### **Option 1: Disable Project Protection (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click on your project:** `ibm-knowledge-public`
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Look for "Password Protection" or "Project Protection"**
5. **Disable any authentication requirements**
6. **Save changes**

### **Option 2: Use Different Platform**

Since Vercel has authentication issues, let's use **Netlify** instead:

1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/start
2. **Click "Deploy manually"**
3. **Drag and drop the `client/build` folder**
4. **Your site will be deployed instantly!**

### **Option 3: Use GitHub Pages**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Go to Settings â†’ Pages**
3. **Select source: Deploy from a branch**
4. **Select branch: main, folder: /client/build**
5. **Save and deploy**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Working Solution:**

Your IBM Knowledge Ecosystem is currently working at:
**http://localhost:3001** (local server)

## ðŸŒŸ **Recommended Action:**

Use **Netlify** - it's free, fast, and doesn't have authentication issues like Vercel.

**Your app is working perfectly locally! Just need to deploy to a public URL.**
